#  CMDLEX  #

`cmdlex` is a command-line utility providing access to the functionality of the KiriScript [`lexer`](https://github.com/kirin-vn/lexer).

##  Usage  ##

>  cmdlex -i path/to/input -o path/to/output

`-i` and `-o` can be omitted; in this case they read from STDIN and STDOUT, respectively.
